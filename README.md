# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules for code quality.

Two official plugins are available for React development with Vite:

- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
  For more details, check the [documentation](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md).

- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: This alternative plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
  For more details, refer to the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc).
